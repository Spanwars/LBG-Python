1. Clone or download the repository from [LBG-Python](https://github.com/CameronGuthrie/LBG-Python.git).

2. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the `lbg.py` script using the Python interpreter:

   ```shell
   python lbg.py
   ```

5. The script will start a Flask server listening on the specified host and port (by default, it uses `localhost:8080`).

6. Use an HTTP client (e.g., cURL or Postman) to interact with the RESTful API provided by the server.

   - To create a new item, send a `POST` request to `http://localhost:8080/create` with the item details in the request body.
   - To read all items, send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:8080/read`.
   - To read a specific item by its ID, send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:8080/read/<item_id>`.
   - To update an item, send a `PUT` request to `http://localhost:8080/update/<item_id>` with the updated item details in the request body.
   - To delete an item, send a `DELETE` request to `http://localhost:8080/delete/<item_id>`.

   Replace `<item_id>` with the actual ID of the item you want to perform the operation on.

7. The server will log the operations and their results to the console for debugging purposes.

Please note that you can customize the host and port by passing the `--PORT` argument when running the script, like this:

```shell
python lbg.py --PORT 5000
```

This will make the server listen on `localhost:5000` instead of the default `localhost:8080`.

Remember to adjust the instructions and API endpoints based on your specific use case and requirements.
